      <description>&lt;p&gt;The why and how it switched form &lt;a

	
	
		href = &#34;https://www.google.com/&#34;

		

	

	

		target = &#34;_blank&#34;
		rel = &#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;

		&gt;
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Google
	&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a

	
	
		href = &#34;https://www.kagi.com/&#34;

		

	

	

		target = &#34;_blank&#34;
		rel = &#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;

		&gt;
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Kagi
	&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-point&#34;&gt;Starting Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic ways to navigate the World Wide Web is through search engines. Not only do browsers almost always have a search engine as the default home page, or use it directly in the search bar. No, searching is so essential to finding what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for that there&amp;rsquo;s even a verb for it, and it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a

	
	
		href = &#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_%28verb%29?useskin=vector&#34;

		

	
		
		title = &#34;bla&#34;
	
	

	

		target = &#34;_blank&#34;
		rel = &#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;

		&gt;
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		to google
	&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;. And that is problematic, because Google is dominant in many countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does somebody start a personal blog? While there are many reasons the more people you ask you will see overlapping patterns. But since this is my first post I think I have to elaborate anyway. At least for the future me to remind him of the specific reasons – and ideally motivating him to keep posting… ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;produce&#34;&gt;Produce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last couple of years I was in a state of mainly consuming. This had several reasons, mainly work exhausted me so much that I could not think of doing anything related to a side project. Also I thought that I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; my hobbies to recharge my batteries to cope with life effectively. This was true for a period of time, but it is no longer the case. Everytime I consumed something (videos, blogs, news but also games, series and movies) I had the strange feeling: Is this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; recharging my batteries?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After some initial struggles, I decided to bring this blog to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-expect&#34;&gt;What to Expect?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an initial blog post on why I started this blog—I already wrote it! I will also write a separate one on why it took so long, but for today, I’ll call it a day. I am glad, happy, and also relieved that it finally went live. See you soon, and don’t forget to check back in a few days!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
