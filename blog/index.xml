      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does somebody start a personal blog? While there are many reasons the more people you ask you will see overlapping patterns. But since this is my first post I think I have to elaborate anyway. At least for the future me to remind him of the specific reasons – and ideally motivating him to keep posting… ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;produce&#34;&gt;Produce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last couple of years I was in a state of mainly consuming. This had several reasons, mainly work exhausted me so much that I could not think of doing anything related to a side project. Also I thought that I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; my hobbies to recharge my batteries to cope with life effectively. This was true for a period of time, but it is no longer the case. Everytime I consumed something (videos, blogs, news but also games, series and movies) I had the strange feeling: Is this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; recharging my batteries?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
